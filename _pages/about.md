Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) within the [AI4Science](https://ai4science-amsterdam.github.io/research/) initiative. My research project aims to develop causal discovery algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks. It is a result of a multi-disciplinary effort of Leendert Hamoen and Martijs Jonker from  [Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences](https://sils.uva.nl/),  [Joris Mooij](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij/) (Korteweg-De Vries Institute for Mathematics) and [Patrick Forr√©](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/PatrickForre/) (AMLab). 

My research aims to shed some light on questions such as how to combine datasets from different environments with non-biological noise or how to find sparse causal graphs in a high-dimensional data setting. Thus, my research projects combine ideas from domain adaptation, causal discovery, and high-dimensional statistics.
